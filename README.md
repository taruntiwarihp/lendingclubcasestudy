> This is to understood the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default, where borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

## Conclusions
- As part of the Lending Club Case Study we have analyzed and would
recommend that the following factors be considered by Consumer Finance
Company to approve / reject the loan of an applicant: <br>
    -  Purpose<br>
    -  Term<br>
    -  Grade<br>
    -  Loan Amount<br>
    -  Interest Rate<br>
    -  Monthly Income<br>
-  Applicants who stay in rented house or mortgage are the maximum who
take loans, so bank can take this as an advantage to grow customers.<br>
-  Customers with a loan purpose of Small Business are more likely to default
as compared to other categories.<br>
-  The defaulters rate is increasing w.r.t term, hence the chances of loan
getting defaulted is less for 36m than 60m.<br>
-  Applicant having purpose debt_consolidate are the maximum applicant for
the loans.<br>
